    drawings come to life.One day, he found a shiny pencil in his backyard. 
    He decided to try it out and drew a big, friendly dog. 
    To his surprise, the dog jumped out of the paper and licked his face.   
    Sam was overjoyed and named him Spot. He drew more things with the magic pencil,
    like a bike, a cake, and a kite. He had so much fun with his new friends.
